# Machine Learning Course Code

Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning course hosted by Birkar Academy and ICDS.ai, taught by Dr. Hadi Veisi from the University of Tehran. This repository contains code and resources used throughout the course to help students understand and apply key machine learning concepts.

**DISCLAIMER**: I only wrote the complete code for the salaries.ipynb and only refined the rest (Dr. Hadi Veisi provided rest of the codes). Some of the codes like the mlp.ipynb were buggy so I debugged them and also added visualazion to them. also thanks to Maryam Khanzadi for her help in visualizing the codes and delivering a clearer and better presentation and explanation of the codes. Also thanks to Zhino Safahi for debugging one of the most peculiar bugs I've encountered
