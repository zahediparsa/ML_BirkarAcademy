# Machine Learning Course Code

Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning course hosted by Birkar Academy and ICDS.ai, taught by Dr. Hadi Veisi from the University of Tehran. This repository contains code and resources used throughout the course to help students understand and apply key machine learning concepts.

**DISCLAIMER**: I only wrote the complete code for the salaries.ipynb and only refined the rest. Some of the codes like the mlp.ipynb were buggy so I debugged them and also added visualazion to them.
